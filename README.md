# Tic-tac-toe-Game
This is a simple two-player Tic-tac-toe game intended for local multiplayer on a single device, such as a computer or laptop. It does not include an option for playing against the computer.
After launching the game, you'll first encounter the menu, where you'll have the option to select the board size, ranging from 3 X 3 to 8 X 8.
In each game, X starts first, then O follows.
The player who aligns a sequence of X's or O's matching the size of the board in a column, row, or diagonal wins.
To initiate a new game, simply click on the 'Replay' button.
In the event of an unexpected closure, the game state is automatically saved.
However, if the closure occurs after the game has concluded (either due to a victory or a draw), the menu will reopen, allowing you to start a new game. 
To exit the game entirely, navigate to the menu and select the 'Exit' button.
